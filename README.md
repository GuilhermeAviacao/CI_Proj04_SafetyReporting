# Aviation Safety Reporting Application

![Responsive Mockup](documentation/amIresponsive.jpg)

Aviation Safety Reporting is a Django-based web application designed to improve aviation safety through voluntary, non-punitive incident reporting. Aviation professionals can submit safety reports, track investigation statuses, and collaborate through comments, fostering a culture of continuous safety improvement.

The system provides role-based access control, allowing regular users to submit and view reports, while investigators can manage investigation statuses and track safety trends through comprehensive dashboards.
